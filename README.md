# Reviews

This is a really renowned course. Take the word of some students to it.

> "Angela is just incredible, awesome and just fantastic in this course. I've never had such an instructor; detailed in every aspect of the course, gives precise explanations, gives you the anxiety to learn etc. She's got that ability to make fun while explaining things for better understanding. I really love this course." - Ekeu MonkamUlrich

> "Angela is very thorough without ever being boring. I've taken MANY online courses in my life including my Bachelors and Masters degrees. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had. This course is packed with thousands of dollars worth of great instruction, and paced well enough for anyone to pick coding up and run with it- Thank you!" - J Carlucci

> "Love the way Angela explains things. Easy to follow and full of logic. I can say she must have spent a lot of energy creating this great course. Thank you and I recommend it to all who's interested in coding!" - Yiqing Zheng

> "So far (on my third day) this course has taught me more than I was able to learn in multiple other programming courses. This course is clearly outlined and builds upon itself gradually in an easy to understand way." - Normal Ramsey

> "This course will take you from beginner to intermediate level for real. If you don't know how to put together the pieces of web development this is what you're looking for. Angela explains in an amazing way by creating projects all the way during this course, explaining the concepts in real practice. Thank you very much, Angela. I will always consider you my mentor. Look forward to taking more courses with you." - Moises Dionisio Cruz

>"An amazing course, perfect for absolute beginners at the start of their coding journey! Angela is an amazing tutor and can explain in the most simple and comprehensible way even complex coding notions. Learning web development cannot get any more fun!" - Zoe Moyssoglou

> "It's a different approach to teaching Web Development. I like that you are given everything possible to succeed from the onset." - Ronick Thomas

> The tutor is simply AMAZING, by far the best tutor I have ever had. I would give her 10 stars out of 5. She is not just punching the code and talking to herself, but she is actually explaining things. She keeps on giving really useful hints and she will give you a great load of other references. I always knew what I was doing and why I was doing it. All the extra challenges have just made me remember and understand things better. - Peter Dlugos
