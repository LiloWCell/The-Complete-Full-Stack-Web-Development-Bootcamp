The following document explains the HTML boilerplate with an explanation of the utilized recourses.

<h1>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h1>
<p>This is the document type declaration. It tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.</p>

&lt;html lang="pt-br"&gt;
<p>This is the opening tag for the HTML document. The lang="pt-br" attribute specifies that the primary language of the document is Brazilian Portuguese.</p>

&lt;head&gt;
<p>The opening tag for the head section of the document. The head contains meta-information about the document that isn't displayed on the page itself.</p>

&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
<p>This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the document. UTF-8 is the most common encoding and supports most characters from all languages.</p>

&lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt;
<p>The title tag defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.</p>

&lt;/head&gt;
<p>The closing tag for the head section.</p>

&lt;body&gt;
<p>The opening tag for the body section. This contains all the visible content of the webpage.</p>

&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
<p>An h1 heading (the largest heading level) that displays the text "Hello World" on the page.</p>

&lt;/body&gt;
<p>The closing tag for the body section.</p>

&lt;/html&gt;
<p>The closing tag for the HTML document, indicating the end of the webpage.</p>

This is a very basic HTML5 document structure with minimal content. The document declares it's in HTML5 format, specifies Portuguese (Brazil) as its language, sets UTF-8 character encoding, gives the page a title, and displays a simple heading in the body.
