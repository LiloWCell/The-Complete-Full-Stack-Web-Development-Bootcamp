## `<!DOCTYPE html>`
This is the **document type** declaration. It **tells** the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

## `<html lang="pt-br">`
This is the **opening tag** for the HTML document. The **`lang="pt-br"`** attribute specifies that the **primary language** of the document is Brazilian Portuguese.

## `<head>`
The **opening tag** for the head section of the document. The head contains **meta-information** about the document that **isn't displayed** on the page itself.

## `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
This meta tag specifies the **character encoding** for the document. UTF-8 is the **most common** encoding and supports most characters from all languages.

## `<title>My Website</title>`
The title tag defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

## `</head>`
The closing tag for the head section.

## `<body>`
The opening tag for the body section. This contains all the visible content of the webpage.

## `<h1>Hello World</h1>`
An h1 heading (the largest heading level) that displays the text "Hello World" on the page.

## `</body>`
The closing tag for the body section.

## `</html>`
The closing tag for the HTML document, indicating the end of the webpage.

This is a very basic HTML5 document structure with minimal content. The document declares it's in HTML5 format, specifies Portuguese (Brazil) as its language, sets UTF-8 character encoding, gives the page a title, and displays a simple heading in the body.
