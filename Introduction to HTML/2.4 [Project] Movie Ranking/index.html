<h1>The best movies acording to Murilo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)</h3>
<p>It was surely an unexpected journey. When the movie finished I was just in shock and disbelief of how good it was; I wanted to consume more and more of it.</p>
<h3>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)</h3>
<p>I was always obsessed about juvenile movies that bring things of adulthood to kids and vice versa. Puss in Boots and the universe that Dreamworks has created is so magic that brings minors and adults together.</p>
<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)</h3>
<p>It was beautiful from start to finish. Just loved the visual art and the spiritual part of the film.</p>
